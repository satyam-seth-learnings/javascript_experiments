            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
            example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
            and data tables.CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS
            Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a specification has been
            discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.
            These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over the actual
            implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create that software.
